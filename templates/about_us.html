    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <p>Our inspiration for this project stemmed from witnessing the challenges people faced when trying to book seats at bus stations. Many endured long queues and wasted precious time just to secure a seat. We recognized the need for a solution that would allow individuals to reserve seats from the comfort of their own homes. This drove us to embark on the journey of developing a reservation system that would alleviate this inconvenience and provide a seamless booking experience for everyone.</p>
